\arguments{
\item{nipt_sample}{The NIPTSample object that is the focus of the analysis}

\item{nipt_control_group}{The NIPTControlGroup object used in the analysis}

\item{chromo_focus}{The chromosome of interest. Most commonly chromosome 13, 18 or 21.
However, every autosomal chromosome can be predicted}

Default potential trisomic chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 are exluded.}

\item{include_chromosomes}{integer. Include potential trisomic chromosomes?
Options are: chromosomes 13, 18 and 21}

\item{use_test_train_set}{Use a test and train set to build the models? Default is TRUE}

\description{
Make multiple models using linear regression and calculate Z-score
}
\details{
The regression based Z-score builds \emph{n} models with \emph{m} predictors using stepwise regression
with forward selection. The models are used to predict the chromosomal fraction of interest, for the
sample and for the control group. The observed fractions are then divided by the expected fraction,
and Z-scores are calculated over these ratios. The Z-score is calculated by subtracting one from the
ratio of the sample and dividing this result by the coefficient of variation.
The coefficient of variation (CV) can either be the Practical or Theoretical CV.
The Theoretical CV is the standard error multiplied by the overdispersion.
Theoretically, the CV cannot be lower than the standard error of the mean.
If it is case the CV is lower than Theoretical CV, then the Theoretical CV is used.


The output of this function is an object of type RegressionResult, a named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \strong{prediction_statistics} A dataframe with 7 rows and a column for every model. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Z_score_sample} The regression based Z score for the model
\item \strong{CV} The coefficient of varation for the model
\item \strong{cv_types} The CV type used to calculate the regression based Z score for the model. Either
\emph{Practical_CV} or \emph{Theoretical_CV}
\item \strong{P_value_shapiro} The P value of the Shaipro-Wilk test for normality of the control group
regression based Z scores for the model
\item \strong{Predictor_chromosomes} The predictor chromosomes used in the model
\item \strong{Mean_test_set} The mean of the test set. Note that for calculating the regression based
Z scores the mean is replaced by one. The mean, however, can be seen as a quality metric for the model
\item \strong{CV_train_set} The CV of the train set. The difference between this CV and the CV of
the test can be used as a measure to quantify overfit
}
\item \strong{control_group_Zscores}  A matrix containing the regression based Z-scores for the control sample
\item \strong{focus_chromosome} he chromosome of interest. Most commonly chromosome 13, 18 or 21.
However, every autosomal chromosome can be predicted
\item \strong{correction_status} The correction status of the control group autosomes
\item \strong{control_group_sample_names} The sample names of the test set group
\item \strong{models} List of the summary.lm output for every model
\item \strong{potential_predictors} The total pool of chromosomes where the predictors are selected from
\item \strong{all_control_group_Z_scores} Z-scores for every sample using theoretical and practical VCs
\item \strong{additional_statistics} Statistics for both the practical and theoretical CVs for every prediction set
