#'Perform a GC bias correction on nipt sample
#'
#'LOESS based GC bias correction algorithm described by Chen et al (2011)
#'
#'@param nipt_object The object that will be corrected. This can either be a 
#'`NIPTSample` or a `NIPTControlGroup` object
#'@param method To select the LOESS based method use  \emph{"LOESS"},  
#'to select the bin weights based method use  \emph{"bin"}. 
#'@param include_XY Also apply correction to X and Y chromosomes? 
#'@param span The span for the LOESS fit. Only applicable when LOESS method is used. 
#'@param ref_genome The reference genome used. Either \emph{"hg37"} or \emph{"hg38"}
#'default = \emph{"hg37"}
#'@details
#'GC content bias is the correlation between the number of reads mapped to a specific genomic 
#'region and the GC content of this region. In NIPTeR, two GC bias correction algorithms 
#'have been implemented, the LOESS based method introduced by Chen et al. (2011) and the bin 
#'weight based method described by Fan and Quake (2010). 
#'@return Depending on the input object either a NIPTSample or a NIPTControlGroup object
