\title{Perform a GC bias correction on nipt sample}
\usage{
gc_correct(nipt_object, method = "LOESS", include_XY = F, span = 0.75,
  ref_genome = "hg37")
}
\arguments{
\item{nipt_object}{The object that will be corrected. This can either be a
`NIPTSample` or a `NIPTControlGroup` object}

\item{method}{To select the LOESS based method use  \emph{"LOESS"},
to select the bin weights based method use  \emph{"bin"}.}

\item{include_XY}{Also apply correction to X and Y chromosomes?}

\item{span}{The span for the LOESS fit. Only applicable when LOESS method is used.}

\item{ref_genome}{The reference genome used. Either \emph{"hg37"} or \emph{"hg38"}
default = \emph{"hg37"}}
}
\value{
Depending on the input object either a NIPTSample or a NIPTControlGroup object
}
\description{
LOESS based GC bias correction algorithm described by Chen et al (2011)
}
\details{
GC content bias is the correlation between the number of reads mapped to a specific genomic
region and the GC content of this region. In NIPTeR, two GC bias correction algorithms
have been implemented, the LOESS based method introduced by Chen et al. (2011) and the bin
weight based method described by Fan and Quake (2010).
