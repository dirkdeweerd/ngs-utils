  exclude_chromosomes = NULL, include_chromosomes = NULL,
  use_test_train_set = T, size_of_train_set = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{nipt_control_group}{The NIPTControlGroup object used in the analysis}

\item{chr_focus}{Integer.The chromosome of interest. Most commonly chromosome 13, 18 or 21.
However, every autosomal chromosome can be predicted}

\item{max_elements}{Integer, The maximum number of denominator chromosomes.}

\item{exclude_chromosomes}{Integer. Exclude which autosomal chromosomes as potential predictors?
Default potential trisomic chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 are exluded.}

\item{include_chromosomes}{Integer. Which potential trisomic chromosomes
(13,18 and 21) to include?}

\item{use_test_train_set}{Boolean. Use a test and train set?}

\item{size_of_train_set}{Double The size of the train set expressed in a decimal.
Default is 0.6 (60\% of the control group samples)}

Determine the best NCV chromosomes,  calculate NCV scores

}
\details{
chromosomes to calculate the chromosomal fractions. The 'best' subset is the set which
yields the lowest coefficient of variation for the chromosomal fractions of the chromosome
of interest in the control group. Because a brute force approach is used to determine the
best subset, which can be computationally intensive,this method is divided into two functions,
prepare_ncv and calculate_ncv. prepare_ncv returns a template object (NCVTemplate) for
a given chromosome of interest and the control group used. This template can be used for
any number of analyses. If the control group or chromosome of interest changes,
a new template must be made.


The ncv_template object is a list containing:
\itemize{
\item Character \strong{denominators} The set of denominator chromosomes
\item Character \strong{focus_chromosome}The chromosome of interest used for this `NCVTemplate` object
\item Character \strong{nipt_sample_names} The sample names of the test set samples
\item Character \strong{correction_status} The correction status(es) of the
control group samples
\item Data.frame \strong{control_group_Z_scores} The NCV scores for the test set samples
\item Character \strong{potential_denominators} The total pool of denominators the best denominators
are selected from
\item Numeric \strong{control_group_statistics} Named num of length 3, the first field being the mean
(name mean), the second field is the standard deviation (name SD) and the third field is the P value
of the Shapiro-Wilk test (name Shapiro_P_value)
}
If a Test and Train set is used the ncv_template object also includes:
\itemize{
\item Character \strong{sample_names_train_set} The sample name where the model
is trained on
\item Numeric \strong{train_set_statistics} Mean, SD and Shapiro-Wilk test
P value of the Z scores of the train set
\item Data.frame \strong{train_set_Zscores} The Z scores of the train set
}
