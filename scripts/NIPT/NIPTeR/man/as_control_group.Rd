\description{
Convert list of nipt samples to nipt control group
}
\details{
This function returns an S3 object of class nipt_control_group. It is a list
with 3 items:

\itemize{
\item List \strong{Samples} nipt_sample objects in the control group
\item Character \strong{Correction_status} Correction_status(es) in the
control group
\item Character \strong{Samplenames} The sample names of samples present
in the control group
}
Read count strategy should be uniform in all samples in a control group object;
meaning samples where forward and reverse reads are counted separately
cannot be in the same control group object as samples where forward and reverse
reads are counted together.

A control group object with duplicate samples or samples with different
correction statusses is possible but not recommended and will generate a
warning message.
